            <h3>CrisOptions Trading Conditions</h3>
            <p>The following terms and conditions form an integral part of your agreement with CrisOption and shall be read carefully; CrisOption does not bear any liability for clients who fail to comply with them. For more information, please contact us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="discover gen-title faq-headers">
            <h4>Market Watch</h4>
            <p>CrisOption Broker strives to ensure that the market watch is accurate and prices are obtained from several major banks/liquidity providers/exchanges; in case of closure/failure of one or more price provider for any or all CFDs, quotes will be provided which will reflect what the company thinks to be the current Bid and Ask price for each CFD; we do not guarantee that our prices are the best prices available on the world market. <br> <br>

                The Client agrees hereunder that our market watch is only an indicator of the current world market and any misunderstanding regarding this service must be returned to CrisOption Operations data. <br> <br>
                
                Moreover, charts for all traded instruments are drawn according to the default spreads, and may differ from the prices displayed on the market watch according to your account type because of differences in markups.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Spread</h4>
            <p>CrisOption Broker offers clients competitive spreads on all instruments, but may rarely make small increases on some or all instruments; ensuring that it provides the best available market conditions and tightest spreads, since one of our most important objectives is to ensure that your orders are executed at the best market price and that you get the tightest spreads available.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Hedging</h4>
            <p>CrisOption allows clients to open positions in the opposite direction of previously opened positions in the trading account, to reduce loss and to decide later when to enter the market. <br> <br>

                Hedging an instrument by its corresponding Future OTC contract is forbidden (for swap-free accounts), because this represents an attempt to take advantage of the swap free facility and gain profits from swaps, one direction of this kind of hedge must be closed immediately. If the client fails to take action to avoid such practices, CrisOption will, unfortunately, be required to close or take other action (by deducting the swaps retroactively or any other means) on these accounts without further notice. <br> <br>
                
                Hedged positions will be held in the trading account without affecting the required margin value, since the required margin is calculated for each instrument according to the net positions opened at a specific moment.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Order Types</h4>
            <p><span class="bold esma">The following orders may be given by the client:</span></p>

                * All pending orders must be placed with respect to the rules appearing in the contract specifications for each instrument. <br> <br>
                
                * Once pending orders are in the process, the system will reject any cancellation or modification attempted during that time. <br> <br>
                
                * Pending order conditions may vary during hectic market conditions. <br> <br>
                
                * If the market opens with a break off after a weekend or holidays, upon release of important economic and political news, or in the case of force majeure events; orders (sell stop, buy stop, stop loss) are fulfilled at the first available prices in the market.</p> <br>

            <h4>Futures: OTC</h4>
            <p>All future trades are classified as market orders, and will be executed according to the market prices provided from its corresponding exchange at the time of execution; in addition, exchange fees may apply. <br> <br>

                Rollover: Futures-OTC contracts will not be rolled over automatically, neither accepting rollover requests from clients; in the case of any client need to rollover a future-otc position/s, open positions on the current contract can be closed and reopened at the next nearby future-otc contract before the last trading day for each contract.

                * Commodities <br>
                * Energies <br> <br>
                
                Where margin, contract size, and general contract specifications are displayed in the Markets Section of the website, and updated periodically.</p> <br>

            <h4>Leverage</h4>    
            <p>Shall mean a ratio in respect of Transaction Size and Initial Margin, 1:100 ratio means that in order to open a position, the Initial Margin required is one percent of the original contract value. <br> <br>

                The 1 (one) standard lot size is the measurement unit specified for each CFD contract. The possible choice of a leverage rate ranges from 1:1 up to 1:500 depending on the type of the CFD, the amount of trading volume active in the account and at the Company's discretion. At the opening of the Client Account, the leverage rate is set at 1:30 by default. The Client may change the leverage of his Client Account by contacting the Company. The Company has the right to allow a change to the Client Account leverage at the Company's discretion. In addition, the Company may, at its discretion, change the Client Account Leverage without any prior notice to the Client. <br> <br>
                
                Regardless of your account type or the amount of equity you have in your account, the leverage you will be allocated to trade with will be determined by the amount of trading volume you have in active use at any given time. <br> <br>
                
                The default leverage on all accounts is 1:30 based on CySEC regulation. Higher leverage will be available only upon client's request and will be executed at our sole discretion. <br> <br>
                
                Professional accounts will be handled individually and may not follow the above leverage rules. <br> <br>
                
                Utilizing a high level of leverage may extend your trading possibilities and lead to larger gains as well as higher risks; risks might be reduced by following a strict trading strategy at the opening and closure of your transactions. For further information, please talk to a Live Support Representative, or view details in the Contact Us page. </p> <br>

            <h4>Margin Requirements</h4>
            <p>The client must abide the rules as declared on the CrisOption broker corporate website Contract Specification section for each CFD, including the margin requirements; and the Client shall provide and maintain the Initial Margin within such limits as the Company, at its sole discretion, may determine, set, or update. <br> <br>

                It is the Client's responsibility to ensure that he understands how a Margin is calculated. <br> <br>
                
                CrisOption has the right to amend any entry in the Contract Specifications section for each CFD including margin requirements, and these changes may take effect on both new and existing/open positions/trades; which may be declared through an internal mail message or on the company's corporate website; unless a Force Majeure Event has occurred. <br> <br>
                
                In case of a Force Majeure Event, CrisOption has the right to change Margin requirements without prior written notice to the Client. In this situation, the Company has the right to apply new Margin requirements to new positions and to positions which are already open. <br> <br>
                
                If the Equity to Margin (necessary margin) ratio falls below 5% at any time, CrisOption has the right to close any or all of the Client's open positions without the Client's consent or any prior written notice. In order to determine if the Client has breached this clause, any sums referred to therein which are not denominated in the Currency of the Client Account shall be treated as if they were denominated in the currency of the Client Account by converting them into the currency of the Client Account at the relevant exchange rate for spot dealings in the foreign exchange market. <br> <br>
                
                The Client is responsible for notifying the Company as soon as he believes that he will be unable to meet a Margin payment when due. <br> <br>
                
                The Company has no obligation to make Margin Calls for the Client. <br> <br>
                
                Where the Company effects or arranges a transaction involving an instrument, the Client should note that, depending upon the nature of the transaction, he may be liable to make further payments when the transaction fails to be completed or upon the earlier settlement or closing out of his position. He may be required to make further variable payments by way of Margin against the purchase price of the instrument, instead of paying (or receiving) the whole purchase (or sale) price immediately. A movement in the market price of the Client's investment will affect the amount of margin payment he will be required to make. The Client agrees to pay the Company on demand such sums by way of margin as are required from time to time under the rules of any relevant Market (if applicable) or as the Company may, at its discretion reasonably require for the purpose of protecting itself against loss or risk of loss on present, future or contemplated transactions under this Agreement.</p> <br>

            <h4>Slippage</h4>
            <p>Slippage involves executing any given trade on a specific price different from the expected price sent or preset by the client. This may take place during highly volatile market conditions such (but not limited to) economic or political news; the order will be filled at the next best available market price because, but not limited to - the desired/preset order price is not available, or because higher spread differences are applied in the corresponding exchanges of the traded instrument. <br> <br>

                CrisOption does not apply slippage under normal market conditions, and applies it on stop pending entry or liquidation orders during times when CrisOption is closed or when - but not limited to - there is a weekend or bank holiday, international economic events or hectic market movements. In this case, stop orders will be filled on the opening price which CrisOption finds suitable. <br> <br>
                
                Clients acknowledge that slippage might occur as per the liquidity providers’ terms and conditions and that this is beyond the control of CrisOption Limited and agrees to waive CrisOption from any liability that may arise subjective to any damage or expense or loss incurred by the Client, in relation to or directly or indirectly arising from but not limited to such terms and conditions. </p> <br>

            <h4>Delivery</h4>
            <p>Physical acquisition by the client of any traded CFD at a specific delivery point worldwide. <br> <br>

                CrisOption does not offer delivery for any position held, opened or closed at the trading platform</p> <br>

            <h4>Scalping</h4>
            <p>Scalping is a trading strategy through which the trader (Scalper/Pip Hunter) attempts to take advantage of small price moves and narrow ranges by making many transactions on small price changes over a small time frame. <br> <br>

                Scalping is allowed on variable spread account types. Please refer to our account types table account types table <br> <br>
                
                However, CrisOption does not permit scalping on Fixed spread account types (Classic account). In case CrisOption classifies a Classic account holder as a scalper or a pip hunter, the company may, at its sole discretion, and without a prior written notice, take one of the following actions: <br> <br>
                
                * Change the account type to the corresponding variable spread account type <br>
                * Terminate this Agreement <br>
                * Close out all or any of the Client's open positions at current market prices <br>
                * Debit the Client Trading Account(s) for the amounts which are due to the Company <br>
                * Close any or all of the Client Trading Accounts held with the Company <br>
                * Combine Client Trading Accounts; consolidate the Balances in such Client Accounts and offset those Balances <br>
                * Refuse to open new Client Trading Accounts for the Client</p> <br>

            <h4>PIP Hunting</h4>
            <p>Shall refer to the situation in which the Client opens a position and closes it in a very short time, usually trading incorrect spikes in the market, or taking advantage of feed indicative prices. <br> <br>

                CrisOption has the right to take any necessary actions similar to scalping clients, at its sole discretion, and without any prior written notice to protect itself since this action is prohibited.</p> <br>

            <h4>News Trading</h4>
            <p>CrisOption allows placing market orders before or during financial news releases. <br>

                However, placing stop orders prior to the release of financial news is not permitted, such orders may be rejected, deleted or filled at the best available market prices at that time.</p> <br>

            <h4>Phone Orders</h4>
            <p>CrisOption allows trading via phone in case of emergencies; all telephone calls placed through the Dealing Desk are recorded by our recording system; records are kept for 10 days.

                * The client must use the EA in a reasonable manner. All EA users in the fixed spread accounts must not use the EA for frequent trading at news time. Users must understand that by using the EA frequently at news time, they prevent other clients from executing a fair trade. <br> <br>
                
                * The Company bears no responsibility when the Client uses additional functionalities of the client trading terminal such as Trailing Stop and/or Expert adviser, which are executed completely under the client’s responsibility, as they depend directly on his trading terminal and the Company bears no responsibility whatsoever.
